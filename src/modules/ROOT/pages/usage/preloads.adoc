== Preloads

The environment variable `BABASHKA_PRELOADS` allows to define code that
will be available in all subsequent usages of babashka.

[source,bash]
----
BABASHKA_PRELOADS='(defn foo [x] (+ x 2))'
BABASHKA_PRELOADS=$BABASHKA_PRELOADS' (defn bar [x] (* x 2))'
export BABASHKA_PRELOADS
----

Note that you can concatenate multiple expressions. Now you can use
these functions in babashka:

[source,bash]
----
$ bb '(-> (foo *input*) bar)' <<< 1
6
----

You can also preload an entire file using `load-file`:

[source,bash]
----
export BABASHKA_PRELOADS='(load-file "my_awesome_prelude.clj")'
----

Note that `*input*` is not available in preloads.
